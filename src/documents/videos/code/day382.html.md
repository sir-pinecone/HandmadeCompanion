    "2:12:50": "Miblo Q: Could you try disabling the randomisation of the ground tile Z? I'm interested to see if that'll adversely affect the sexiness of the depth peel"

    "2:14:28": "thesizik Q: Debug menu's broken now"

    "2:16:30": "pragmascrypt Q: For depth peeling: would it be possible to discard all pixels in the 2nd layer that have an alpha value of 255 in the front layer because they are not interesting for the composition anyway?"
    "2:19:20": "alexkelbo Q: I'm behind on day 130, just finished the SIMD / thread introduction. What feature of the game eventually forced you to use the GPU? (Totally love the software rendering)"
    "2:21:12": "alexkelbo Q: Is the game going to be more 3D-ish gameplay-wise than originally planned?"
    "2:22:32": "napoleon89 Q: So is the depth peeling being used for order-independent transparency with the sprites?"
    "2:23:44": "zzyzzyxx Q: Can you go into more detail on what fixed layers 2 / 3 from being all black? It wasn't an old card only being able to read two textures, but I missed the actual resolution"
    "2:24:04": "OpenGL assumes that textures are mipmapped"
    "2:26:52": "k2t0f12d Q: Do you actually have to have wireframe models to be considered 2.5D, or would this count as well?"
    "2:28:28": "k2t0f12d Q: You could define your own render definition for HMD"
    "2:29:47": "alexkelbo Q: Is the floor below us being drawn completely and the one we are on on top of it, or is the one below clipped so only the pixels we see through the holes are drawn?"
