    "2:14:22": "vaualbus Q: We will use VBO and IBO? In that case you prefer using glBufferData to send TGE data into the buffer or using glMapBuffer / glUnmapBuffer to send the data?"
    "2:17:30": "robrobby Q: Will you use 4coder in full window mode (4ed.exe -F) in the future?"
    "2:18:16": "macielda Q: By moving the construction of the vertex array to the RenderGroup, we kind of miss the opportunity of writing the quads directly into driver-owned memory, e.g. glMapBuffer. Is that statement correct? If so, is that a problem?"
    "2:20:08": "kim_jorgensen Q: Couldn't OpenGLGetProcAddress just return the method directly on some platforms, using string lookup?"
    "2:21:36": "jessem3y3r Q: Why not build one massive vertex buffer and just draw that once?"
    "2:23:51": "jessem3y3r Q: I see, thanks! Any chance we can see a render callstack from nsight or renderdoc just to see what the driver has to work through?"

    "2:26:04": "Run the game in RenderDoc"

    "2:29:47": "macielda Q: Does the Debug UI still work? If so, how does one activate it?"
    "2:30:08": "Jim0_o Q: Have you set a version target for the pipeline? Will you go full Embedded Systems bananas (OpenGL ES)?"
    "2:30:30": "Close it down with a glimpse into the future"
