    "1:01:41": "miblo Q: Are you expecting a new batch of art from Yangtian?"
    "1:02:01": "ciastek3214 Q: Are you gonna eventually downgrade the graphics to stir up some controversy and get the game talked about on NeoGAF and Reddit?"
    "1:03:12": "johnicholas Q: What are some example changes to the gameplay that would require changes to the tags?"
    "1:03:53": "biolumonix Q: What certifications do you have?"

    "1:04:41": "butwhynot1 Q: Are you going to show the asset pipeline tools programming on stream?"
    "1:05:32": "poohshoes Q: I missed the pre-stream. Did you talk about APIs like you said you would on twitter?"
    "1:05:51": "mojobojo Q: What reason is there to use size_t other than int32 or uint32?"
    "1:07:00": "ciastek3214 Q: Do you plan on implementing HTC Vive and Lighthouse support for whatever reason?"
    "1:07:32": "twiebs Q: If the asset pipeline won't be done on stream, will you still release the source for it?"
    "1:08:43": "corujanova Q: Will you do a separate isolated session on databases (mentioned yesterday)? I would love to hear your thoughts on that"
    "1:09:12": "poohshoes Q: Will you talk about APIs now?"
