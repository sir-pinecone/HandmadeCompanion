    "1:55:13": "fr0styninja Q: Cam died"
    "1:56:05": "soysaucethekid Q: For some of the OpenGL function typedefs, you have the WINAPI entrypoint and others don't. I thought it was necessary to have it or else you get run-time errors when calling those functions (or at least I did)"
    "1:57:13": "thesizik Q: Instead of Z-bias, why not make the sprite cards stand up at a steeper angle, and make them trapezoidal to undo the perspective foreshortening?"
    "1:58:14": "bimbinel Q: When you started writing the placeholder shader code you mentioned something about “C++ ??? docs” that are not yet fully implemented. What is this feature exactly? [see Resources, Wikipedia]"
    "2:01:36": "pepevel Q: Do you think the Google's angle library (that translates OpenGL to DirectX calls) would solve the sRGB problem on your graphics card?"
    "2:02:24": "gunstarrhero Q: Why are you downsizing 8 pixels into one using blit and not using 32 bit math and rendering 6 back into 2 with a subtract to finalize 8? 2 pass out of 8 bit back to render allows alpha on/off values and colour value attach. ( A|C| instead of colour value) where alpha belongs in blit, define each pixel"
    "2:03:24": "insofaras Q: You can pass NULL as the length param to glShaderSource and it treats all the strings as null terminated"
    "2:03:35": "handmade_opengl.cpp: Make OpenGLCreateProgram() pass NULL to glShaderSource()"
    "2:04:44": "fr0styninja Q: Can't we just adjust gamma in the shaders?"
    "2:05:27": "fr0styninja Q: Regarding checking shaders status. Believe best practice is checking GL_COMPILE_STATUS after compiling a shader and then GL_LINK_STATUS after linking a program"
    "2:06:25": "bimbinel Q: Are you eventually going to move shader code into the asset packs, or are you going to keep it inline?"
    "2:06:45": "thesizik Q: Won't there still be problems if a tree is in front of a tall block, if the sprite still technically intersects the tile above?"
    "2:08:04": "aceflameseer Q: Will you implement shader \"hotloading\"?"
    "2:10:01": "enemymouse Q: Hotloading seems safest with the use of BindAttribLocation, correct, so as not to have to chase locations all over the place?"
    "2:10:46": "xyane Q: Last time I was here you talked about the int32x types. What are your thoughts on type space vs cache utilization?"
    "2:12:17": "ratchetfreak Q: If you recreate the program when hot reloading, you should probably free the old shaders and program"
    "2:13:52": "abarishu Q: Are those programs cleared automatically when the game exits?"
    "2:14:43": "macielda Q: Do you have opinions about Temporal AA?"
    "2:14:52": "xyane Q: I assume that you dont give much thought to how hot data is? I remember a talk by Andrei that you could get a few percent speed up just from organizing the data according to hotness"
    "2:17:04": "abarishu Q: \"Unless there is a bug in the driver or in Windows...\" Yeah, there are never any bugs in those"
    "2:18:14": "xyane Q: Will you eventually be doing such a pass over Handmade Hero?"
    "2:18:32": "pepevel Q: Should you add a \n at the end of each line with the format you are using? Wouldn't it be parsed by OpenGL as a long comment as it is now?"
    "2:19:44": "starchypancakes Q: Hey Casey, I got a job as a gameplay programmer! Wouldn't have happened without this stream, not in a million years"
    "2:20:23": "A few words on gameplay programming"
    "2:22:37": "Wrap the rest of the stream up with well wishes for @starchypancakes (!quote 555)"
