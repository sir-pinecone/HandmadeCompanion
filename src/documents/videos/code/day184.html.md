    "58:45": "elxenoaizd Q: What would be the most important things you'd look at when hiring a programmer? What type of questions would you ask? Does he have to have, like, 20+ years of experience?"
    "1:00:54": "garryjohanson Q: Do you think you do not need to ever worry about modulus or divides anymore?"
