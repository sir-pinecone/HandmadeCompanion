    "1:05:07": "In the first version of vector, weren't you just missing an anonymous struct in the union?"
    "1:07:23": "How do you remember all these commands?"
    "1:08:47": "Is there a performance reason not to use constructors for v2?"
    "1:10:16": "When would the fact that objects members are private or public come in to play?"
    "1:12:04": "You should be able to have compound assignments outside the object."
    "1:14:02": "If you're using vertical bars for vectors, how would you notate the determinant?"
    "1:14:02": "If you're using vertical bars for vectors, how would you notate the determinant?"
    "1:15:23": "Can't you make the whole vector struct an union?"
    "1:16:30": "Does the altered v2 work now if you comment out the constructor?"
    "1:18:09": "What libs are you using?"
    "1:18:17": "Just tested the v2 struct in llvm and it compiles fine."
    "1:18:40": "If I remember correctly, both gcc and llvm complains about the union struct"
    "1:19:33": "Do you have any book recommandations for vector math?"
    "1:22:14": "Will you define vector and scalar addition?"
    "1:25:15": "Any particular reason to not supporting both vector-scalar and scalar-vector operators?"
    "1:26:19": "The earlier struct-syntax is C99"
    "1:26:37": "Does not returning real32 instead of v2 in *= operator trim your y-value?"
    "1:28:25": "In C++11 you can do (v2){5, 2} as v2{5, 3}"
    "1:29:43": "Don't you need some graphics library to place stuff not in a console?"
    "1:31:20": "It's time to upgrade your copyright notice!"
    "1:32:19": "Do you have use for constants like v2up, v2down etc?"
    "1:33:50": "Copyright should cover all years in which content was contributed"
    "1:34:48": "How about adding const references to function parameters to avoid copy by value"
    "1:35:53": "Doesn't const help the compiler optimize?"
