    "1:57:52": "sahfortv Q: There seems to be a second problem with StairCam 1 vs StairCam 2, i.e. you need to be moving even though you're on the first stair, so the collision areas are out a bit?"
    "1:58:38": "rooctag Q: Why are the trees below smaller than the trees up top?"
    "2:01:36": "butwhynot1 Q: Are you going to experiment zooming by changing the FOV rather than changing the distance?"
    "2:02:09": "macielda Q: Why use velocity and not, for instance, acceleration as a constraint parameter?"
    "2:02:43": "m0re85 Q: Why are the health bars flickering? Seems to be most noticeable when the hero is at standstill (the familiars move all the time and they don't flicker as much)"
    "2:03:30": "handmade_entity.cpp: Enable DrawHitpoints() to prevent Z-fighting"
    "2:04:19": "radovik Q: Off-topic: Is it normal for a trivial code change to lead to a 250MB diff file? Is this optimization / MIPS architecture weirdness?"
    "2:05:18": "rooctag Q: What do you want to fit in the camera view? Whole room, or some amount of tiles so camera movement per room is needed"
    "2:05:53": "ahoward1024 Q: Hey Casey, in the PushBitmap function of the handmade_render_group you have a shadowed v4 parameter Color that is masked by the u32 Color. Compiles as a warning (to an error) in VS 2015"
    "2:07:21": "handmade_render_group.cpp: Move in PushSetup() and transient_clip_rect from handmade_render_group.h [see Resources, GitHub]"
    "2:09:19": "teamrandb Q: Does the profiler still work? If not, what is a quick overview of the work that is needed to get it working again? And was it purely a display issue that we could not see it?"
    "2:10:40": "handmade_render_group.cpp: Fix GetClipRect() to correctly clip the profiler's text"
    "2:15:39": "handmade_render_group.cpp: Introduce GetScreenPoint() for GetClipRect() to call"

    "2:20:03": "Blackboard: Mapping screen dimensions to -1 to 1"
    "2:22:18": "handmade_opengl.cpp: Try disabling the ClipRect bounds setting"
    "2:26:33": "Run the game to see what's going on with the clipping"
    "2:28:09": "teamrandb Q: Thanks Casey, appreciate you walking through it"
    "2:28:44": "handmade_render_group.cpp: Temporarily prevent the clipping from occuring and run the game to see that"
    "2:29:41": "macielda Q: Can you click \"Threads\" on the Profile window?"

    "2:31:55": "Sign off"
