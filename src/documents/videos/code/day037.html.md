## Quotes

* 164\. ...so there's no more mysteries, no more 'I-don't-really-know-what-it-does-down-there' kinda stuff. We're goin' in, cleaning out all the cobwebs, going into 'the basement', if you will; finding out what your creepy grandfather put down there, or what weird pickling experiment someone did. And you don't necessarily want to eat it. So, you know, sometimes it's gross; it's true
