    "2:10:07": "snoringtortoise Q: You mentioned in a previous episode that one of the reasons for moving to 3D was due to performance concerns with the sorting. Would it have been a viable alternative to keep the sorting results in permanent storage and then each frame only re-sort the entities that have moved? Just considering that many entities like trees and traversables don't move"
    "2:12:29": "macielda Q: Casey, I have started working on Handmade Vulkan port earlier today, is that okay? I got it to initialize properly and have done some groundwork for outputting rects. My current plan is to work on it this week"
    "2:15:33": "macielda Q: So Alpha to Coverage does order-independent transparency just like that? Any serious limitations you can think of?"
    "2:17:50": "snoringtortoise Q: For those of us who are very interested in engine development, what are some of the more advanced platform features that you would recommend investigating?"
    "2:20:17": "\"The only reason that we ever did it is because Won insisted that we do it\" (!quote 552)"
    "2:21:26": "snoringtortoise Q: On the platform side like any debugging features, you mentioned a while ago that 1935's engine was light years ahead in that it is far more advanced"
