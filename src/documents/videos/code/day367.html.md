    "2:10:07": "snoringtortoise Q: You mentioned in a previous episode that one of the reasons for moving to 3D was due to performance concerns with the sorting. Would it have been a viable alternative to keep the sorting results in permanent storage and then each frame only re-sort the entities that have moved? Just considering that many entities like trees and traversables don't move"
