    "2:06:54": "desuused Q: Here's your equations solved in maxima [image], and here's your equations solved with expanding (sinÎ¸)^2 through dot product: [image]. I think this approach is completely wrong when trying to derive cross product"
    "2:07:50": "ingenero Q: What would be the downside of drawing your debug lines as 3D cylinders or extruded rectangles? It seems like that would look a little nice when viewed from all angles"
    "2:10:18": "vaualbus Q: Also shall we draw the cubes around the room?"
    "2:10:47": "handmade_entity.cpp: Make UpdateAndRenderEntities() draw collision volumes"
    "2:12:06": "Run the game to see what that does"
    "2:12:37": "handmade_render_group.cpp: Make PushVolumeOutline() take the ObjectTransform into account"
    "2:13:32": "Run the game to see the collision volumes"
    "2:15:10": "handmade_render_group.cpp: Enable SetCameraTransform() to set the DebugXForm in both modes, and run the game to see the collision volumes in the game mode"
    "2:16:44": "desuused Q: You mentioned that you use discriminated unions. Have you seen Rust's implementation of sum types?"
    "2:16:59": "jezzi23 Q: I was looking at how the vector types are set up in Handmade Hero as unions. As far as I know, it's undefined behaviour to write value to one type of a union and then read as another type. Is doing something like this well defined - vec1.x = 5.0f and then read as vec1.E[0] - or is it one of the cases where we rely that a reasonable compiler will do the right thing?"
    "2:20:39": "desuused Q: Would you describe discriminated union to the general public?"
    "2:20:50": "Blackboard: Struct, as a representations of data in memory"
    "2:24:12": "Blackboard: Union, as a combination of structs"
    "2:26:21": "Blackboard: Discriminated union, as a union containing a type field"
    "2:30:03": "Blackboard: Inheritance in C++"
    "2:32:32": "graham1642 Q: Can you give a motivating example for these discriminating unions?"
    "2:33:11": "Blackboard: A \"single dispatch\" example in which a discriminated union and inheritance work equally well"
    "2:38:54": "Blackboard: The tractability of Single vs Double Dispatch"
    "2:40:00": "Blackboard: A \"double dispatch\" example in which a discriminated union excels"
    "2:46:06": "Blackboard: Generating a sparse matrix containing the cases you care about"
    "2:49:34": "Blackboard: Discriminated unions shine in enabling the ability to write code which looks at the way in which types are set among more than one object"
    "2:53:44": "cubercaleb Q: How would you feel if you wrote the functions for colliding each pair or types, and allowed the compiler to generate the sparse matrix of function calls for you?"
    "2:55:09": "Recommend researching category theory, with a call for @Pseudonym73"
    "3:00:12": "cynokron Q: Are you hoping JAI will have discriminated unions?"
    "3:00:32": "Wind down here"
