    "2:09:05": "soysaucethekid Q: Is OpenGL 3.0 the target version?"
    "2:11:14": "rizoma80 Q: Any idea why one can have stuttering problems using OpenGL DWM stuff related?"
    "2:14:01": "macielda Q: What do you like better in OpenGL AZDO as opposed to Vulkan?"
    "2:18:35": "pepevel Q: Would it be interesting to implement OpenGL on top of OpenCL?"
    "2:19:54": "robrobby Q: Since Handmade Hero is using multithreaded processing of the game entities, how would the game even stutter when time wouldn't be enough 'til the next frame?"
    "2:21:01": "Shut this down"
