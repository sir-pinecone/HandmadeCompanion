    "2:02:21": "hguleryuz Q: What do you think about using a different set of program / shader for debug text, one which has no projection matrix at all? Would it be bad to switch programs for GUI text performance-wise?"
    "2:05:40": "ratchetfreak Q: There is a third way of setting the vertex data through ARB_separate_attrib_format (went to core in 4.3). This separates the vertex format from the buffer it reads the data from which is more optimal for the driver"
