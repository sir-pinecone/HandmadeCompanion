    "43:27": "Run the game to make sure that it works okay"
    "43:38": "handmade_opengl.cpp: Enable the multisampling path"
    "47:29": "Note that we cannot render from a multisampled texture as if it was a regular texture"
    "49:00": "handmade_opengl.cpp: Look into making OpenGLRenderCommands() conditionally bind depending on whether or not we're multisampling"
    "49:54": "handmade_opengl.cpp: Back out our changes and instead just create two framebuffers: one multisampled, one not"

    "1:03:23": "Consider using conservative rasterization"
    "1:05:33": "Determine to do everything multisampled, consulting the OpenGL documentation for sampler2DMS [see Resources, OpenGL Registry]"
    "1:14:26": "When evaluating a given sample from a multisampled buffer, we want to get its corresponding depth sample"
    "1:17:52": "Note that conservative rasterization would definitely solve our problem"
    "1:19:31": "Consult the OpenGL Hardware Database to see which cards support GL_NV_conservative_raster and GL_INTEL_conservative_rasterization [see Resources, OpenGL Hardware Database]"
    "1:20:44": "Run the game and consider what's causing the slowness"
    "1:22:37": "handmade_opengl.cpp: Toggle back to non-multisampling, run the game to see that the frame rate is fine, and continue considering the slowness"
    "1:24:37": "handmade_opengl.cpp: Determine to enable the multisampling path to pick the closest depth value [see Resources, OpenGL Registry]"
    "1:30:49": "handmade_opengl.cpp: Introduce ResolveMultisample()"

    "1:48:53": "Q&A"
    "1:49:46": "flyingsolomon Q: I think it will be useful to bind a key to topmost window as there is a key to full screen, then you will not have to resize your editor for live code editing. Also, since I bound the ` key to -> in my editor I'm a very happy panda, warm recommendations"
    "1:50:27": "ravarix Q: Why s32 for the count, instead of u32?"
    "1:51:03": "dragoonx6 Q: Could you up the bitrate? It's really hard to watch when there's too much movement on the screen. It gets all blurry and pixelated. Not exaggerating when I say it makes my eyes watery"
    "1:52:50": "Wrap things up with a plug of the episode guide's new search feature [see Resources, Handmade Hero]"
