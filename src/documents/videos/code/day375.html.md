markers:
    "2:15:57": "Q&A"
    "2:16:50": "nyeecola Q: Has the framerate tanked after implementing fog? Or was that a wrong impression of mine?"
    "2:17:02": "Compile and run with various optimisation settings"
    "2:19:54": "Miblo Q: Now that we're full 3D, may it be worth extending the debug visualisation rectangles into the third dimension?"
    "2:20:19": "nyeecola Q: Why would you (in this case) compile without optimizations? I don't get how it changes your framerate that much (sorry if this is a dumb question)"
    "2:21:28": "handmade_sim_region.cpp: Make a KillSwitch to disable GetClosestTraversable()"
    "2:23:42": "Run the game and compare the framerate with and without GetClosestTraversable() running"
    "2:25:43": "Step in to GetClosestTraversable() and calculate how many operations it performs, and the number of cycles in which it must execute"
    "2:30:12": "Look at the disassembly for GetClosestTraversable() when compiled with -Od"
    "2:33:00": "Switch to -O2 and look at the disassembly for GetClosestTraversable() again"
    "2:36:08": "Compiling with optimisations on inhibits our ability to debug the code effectively"
    "2:39:55": "macielda Q: How do you feel about Uniform Buffer Objects? Am I right to assume the Render Setup struct could be passed to the shader as an UBO instead of separate Uniforms?"
    "2:40:24": "macielda Q: How does the hero know it should hop to the lower level instead of the upper level at the end of the stairs? Where is the code for that?"
    "2:41:10": "thesizik Q: What does the software renderer look like at the moment?"
    "2:41:33": "chrysos42 Q: I assume the problems you solve in Handmade Hero are fairly representative of problems you face as a game dev. Can you comment about any social aspects of being a game dev, e.g. how collaborative or supportive the community is, or what it's like sharing a codebase with a number of others?"
    "2:44:18": "rocketbuny Q: How many lines of code does Handmade Hero have?"
    "2:47:42": "Wind it on down"
