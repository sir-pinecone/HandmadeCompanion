    "2:41:33": "chrysos42 Q: I assume the problems you solve in Handmade Hero are fairly representative of problems you face as a game dev. Can you comment about any social aspects of being a game dev, e.g. how collaborative or supportive the community is, or what it's like sharing a codebase with a number of others?"
    "2:44:18": "rocketbuny Q: How many lines of code does Handmade Hero have?"
    "2:47:42": "Wind it on down with a glimpse into the future"
