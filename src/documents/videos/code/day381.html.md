    "1:58:19": "sausagesuperb Q: I tend to see in a lot of APIs (for example SDL) things like DestroyWindow calls. If this is the last thing you do before exiting the app, doesn't the operating system take care of this for you?"
    "1:59:45": "daniel_collin Q: Have you considered keeping the shader code as separate files so you can do automatic reload on save in the editor, for example, or do you think there won't be enough shader code to motivate the work?"
    "2:00:55": "handmade_opengl.cpp: Investigate why glDrawArrays() is busted"
    "2:03:40": "itfrombit Q: I think your last hardcoded giant triangle strip UV mapping coordinate has a cut and paste error. Should be {1.0, 0.0} instead of {1.0, 1.0}?"
    "2:03:52": "handmade_opengl.cpp: Fix the final coordinate in Vertices and run the game to see that that wasn't enough to save us"
    "2:04:10": "daniel_collin Q: By the way, it was pointed out that the compatibility bit only works in 3.2+ (and I think you specify 3.0 currently)"
    "2:04:19": "tmellemseter Q: A bit off-topic, but why is not The Jeff and Casey Show Season 5 on the Molly Rocket website?"
    "2:04:47": "Consider what may be going wrong in our shader"
    "2:07:32": "daniel_collin Q: I was told that you had some issue(s) with RenderDoc. Do you know if it was related to you having a old GPU or was it a real bug in Renderdoc?"
    "2:08:52": "sahfortv Q: Could you view in the debugger and see if the shader outputs sensible values?"
    "2:09:10": "sausagesuperb Q: In the future when Jon Blow's language is released for public (in case it will be before Handmade Hero completion), will you switch to use it for finishing unfinished parts of the game, or would you stay with C/C++ until the bitter end?"
    "2:10:18": "That is it"
