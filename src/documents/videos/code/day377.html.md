    "1:35:59": "kknewkles Q: Hi Casey! Two questions: 1) How come RAD aren't owning every avenue of compression in existence, like video codecs? and 2) Will Handmade Hero at some point be beautifully, 2D-animated like the excellent, excellent Hollow Knight, that everyone should play, by the way?"
    "1:39:31": "sausagesuperb Q: Why don't you search and replace for the new short sexy data types"
    "1:39:41": "kknewkles Q: That was Shovel Knight! Hollow Knight is a new game!"
    "1:40:19": "0xdeadbeefh Q: Is the camera for this game gonna be plenty smart or just a little smart? In this staircase I imagine you might want to measure the velocity of the player to not have it affect the camera if the player is rushing straight past"
    "1:41:22": "handmade_sim_region.cpp: Prevent the camera from panning to the staircase unless the hero is traversing the stairs"
    "1:42:21": "Run the game to see how that works"
    "1:43:07": "macielda Q: Is the Debug Text draw order still inverted? It seems so by the looks of the Debug text. Is the profiler still working?"
    "1:43:41": "teamrandb Q: Greetings Casey! Last week during the wonderful Handmade Chat you demonstrated how to dynamically create code in memory. You have mentioned in the past how you do a fair bit of meta-programming and I always envisioned that you would generate C / C++ code to files. When you tackle meta-programming, do you write out to disk first and then have it compiled? Do you do it all in memory similar to what you did last week? Combination of both?"
    "1:45:28": "jezzi23 Q: Hey Casey. I was messing around with 4x4 matrix multiplication implementations and whipped out ten variations, some of which naive and others more optimal with SIMD. Out of curiosity I performance tested them all on MSVC, clang and gcc. I was very surprised by the results as the compilers seem to be doing very different things for this simple task. For example, on gcc the naive versions sometimes beat what I thought would be optimal SIMD (seems like it was able to output better intrinsics) but on clang it was the opposite. MSVC seems to have failed at unrolling a loop and all implementations were crap except for a manually unrolled SIMD version. I realize this is a rathole of a problem but is this really where we're at in terms of the philosophy of \"write once and let each compiler do the best thing for the platform\"? Any thoughts?"
    "1:53:31": "macielda Q: I remember you mentioned at some point that you were really interested in Salt & Sanctuary. Have you played it? Did you work on that game?"
    "1:53:51": "wordisnull Q: Can you please explain once more why you kept CameraOffsetZ? Is it for movement beetwen tilemaps or for something else?"
    "1:54:05": "Blackboard: Encoding the location the camera is looking at"
    "1:56:07": "m0re85 Q: If it's too off-topic I'll ask tomorrow during pre-stream, follow up on devirtualization: Your main criticism about virtual functions was the overhead you get from the indirection, so with devirtualization would you consider using them, or are there any other downsides compared to tagged unions?"
