    "1:51:25": "macielda Q: Any particular reason for using counter clockwise for front faces (as opposed to clockwise)?"
    "1:52:00": "Blackboard: Coordinate system right-handedness and counter-clockwise winding"
    "1:56:23": "thesizik Q: A debug camera pan control might be a good idea"
    "1:56:35": "coreactivities Q: Why have everything slightly tilted? Wouldn't it make more sense to sort the assets according to their bottom or, if you're using 3D space, go for an orthogonal camera and using the Z position for sorting?"
    "1:57:09": "Run the game to demo the visual interest of the tilting [see Resources, Molly Rocket]"
    "2:01:28": "Recommend Andrew Russell's blog on the sorting in River City Ransom [see Resources, Andrew Russell]"
    "2:06:41": "macielda Q: I noticed the camera in Handmade Hero is defined by Camera X, Y, Z and P. Can I get X, Y and Z from a Quaternion? Is that a good idea? I mean, if you had Quaternions on Handmade Hero would you define the camera using a Quaternion and P?"
    "2:08:18": "macielda Q: What is the 'x' in b32x and u32x?"
    "2:08:41": "Blackboard: \"Exactly n bits\" vs \"At least n bits\""
    "2:13:47": "jezzi23 Q: How much time and effort do you spend preparing for each episode (e.g. what you're going to do, and which problems you foresee running into)? Or is it just the years of experience that allow you to do this without preparation?"
    "2:14:28": "macielda Q: Why b32x and not b1x or b8x? (I really don't know)"
    "2:15:46": "dudeinbasement1	Q: Can you do cubic splines sometime? [see Resources, YouTube]"
    "2:17:00": "Close it down"
