	"0:59:05": "vellyx Q: Everything works the first time because you think out loud."
	"0:59:51": "gasto5 Q: Does the yellow part represent the loaded bitmaps?"
	"1:02:20": "mojobojo Q: What does it mean to invalidate cache?"
	"1:02:30": "Blackboard: Cache invalidation"
	"1:08:57": "mr4thdimention Q: Could you summarize what you did tonight? Found it a little hard to follow along."
	"1:10:58": "childz Q: Could you explain what is meant when one says something is done serially?"
	"1:13:13": "pseudonym73 Q: I missed a bit of the stream after you removed scale. Didn't you use that for scaling by Z?"
	"1:14:26": "gasto5 Q: What's happening between staircase passing in the bitmaps? Is it simple scaling based on the Z axis?"
	"1:18:33": "boomboxbeat Q: How many FPS is this running at?"
	"1:19:23": "vellyx Q: To make the 3D appearance of the staircase, would you have to make render technique to draw the walls of the staircase to start from the bottom floor and end at the top floor?"
	"1:19:41": "gasto5 Q: When do you consider consulting other programmers? Where is the threshold?"
	"1:20:32": "kemosabe76 Q: What happens if you want to apply different transforms or lighting to different parts of a scene?"
	"1:21:14": "robrobby Q: What do you expect will be the boost using OpenGL/D3D for blitting?"
	"1:21:51": "rasoilo Q: Is there a concept of local space / model space / camera space / clip space in the renderer that is analgous to the kinds of translations in OpenGL/D3D that you would want?"
	"1:23:15": "vaporpowaaa Q: Unrelated to the stream, I found a video where you explain quaternion double cover, but there is no explanation of quaternions. Would you consider doing on in the near future?"
	"1:24:20": "Finishing it up"
