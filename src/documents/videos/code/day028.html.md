    "1:02:40": "Run the game to see that the movement speed is as expected"
    "1:03:07": "garlandobloom Q: Maybe we should sync our frames with vsync due to it dropping our frames"
    "1:03:50": "Q: On the topic of tilemap size maybe use smaller tiles then use 2 tiles for doors"
    "1:04:26": "Q: Why not use anything created before like SDL, OpenGL, and so on?"
    "1:05:43": "Q: Fixed-point or floating point"
    "1:06:22": "Q: Wouldn't one expect four pixels per frame at 30FPS to look a little jerky"
    "1:07:28": "Q: Yesterday you discussed explorative programming. How do you compare that with AGILE development style?"
    "1:10:05": "Q: Was procrastination a problem for you?"
    "1:11:33": "Q: Could all the print output cause the lag in the input?"
    "1:12:07": "Q: Use some space on the top / bottom for UI"
    "1:12:17": "Q: The desktop V-sync issue will only be a problem on Windows Vista+, which means we can use the command to get it from the DWM there, and use the direct draw one on Windows XP"
    "1:12:34": "Q: Can we pack the colors in a struct?"
    "1:12:40": "Q: Is there a reason to set the tiles to a square other than ease of use?"
    "1:13:20": "Q: Do you add anything to your almond milk other than soaked almonds and water?"
    "1:13:24": "Q: From yesterday's stream, how can you tell the difference in how to change the direction of your design or is that a fundamentally hard problem"
    "1:16:17": "Q: Would it be bad to do a rectangle tile, since you get a rectangle by doing an ortho view of it anyway?"
    "1:18:07": "Q: What debugger do you use on Linux?"
    "1:19:35": "Q: Why do we see nine threads on the program exit?"
    "1:23:03": "Q: Are we locked into a tile size once we get going or can we make that dynamic per level or room in the future?"
    "1:23:55": "Q: DWM_TIMING_INFO.qpcVBlank is the qpc value before the VBlank"
    "1:24:22": "Q: Why do you not clean up your code? It will be harder to find bugs if you do not"
    "1:24:37": "Q: What about selling T-shirts?"
    "1:24:58": "Q: With your compression-based approach do you find yourself writing facades for everything so you and others can interact with the modules"
    "1:26:15": "Q: Why not use Clang?"
    "1:26:27": "Q: I am a young adult who would like to get into coding, but everywhere I go lands up with the same stuff which leads to be boring and not interactive. How does one learn code?"
    "1:26:50": "Q: Since how you arrange the elements in your struct can influence the size, is there a rule to follow on how to organise your structure?"
    "1:27:18": "Q: You just have to right-click the stack frame in the Call Stack view, and download from MS symbol servers"
    "1:30:59": "Q: Assert assumptions in DrawRectangle()?"
